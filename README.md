# PROTRACTOR - A Proximity Sensor that Measures Angles

This Library works with the Protractor Sensor. A lot of sensors can tell the distance to an object, but determining the angle to an object is much harder. With a 180 degree field of view, the Protractor can sense open pathways and tell the angle to multiple objects up to 30cm (12 inches) away.  With a Protractor mounted to your mobile robot, you can easily find or avoid objects.

The Protractor is designed to work well with Mini Sumo robots, and can also be used as a general purpose proximity sensor.

The Protractor communicates with a master using either Serial Bus or I2C communication. Examples for using the Protractor with an Arduino are provided for both Serial and I2C. The Protractor has level shifters included on all communication lines and can be interfaced with either 5V or 3.3V microcontrollers.

### BASIC FUNCTIONS

The Protractor library provides a command to read all available data from the Protractor Sensor. The data is stored inside the master's memory.

The Protractor library provides a command which tells the number of objects which are detected by the sensor. Another command tells the number of open paths detected by the sensor.

The Protractor library provides a command which tells the angle between the sensor and an object. Another command tells the angle between the sensor and an open path.

### ADVANCED FUNCTIONS

The Protractor library provides a command to change the sensor's I2C address. The default I2C address of all Protractors is set to 69 (0x45) during manufacture. Changing the default I2C address allows connecting multiple Protractors to a single host microcontroller. The Protractor must be reset for the new address to take effect. The Protractor will remember the new I2C address after it is powered down and restarted.

The Protractor library provides a command to change the sensor's Serial baud rate. The default baud rate is 9600. If the wiring connections to the host microcontroller are short, high baud rates can be used to achieve faster communications. If the wiring connections are long, slower baud rates can be used to reduce communication errors. Note: The baud rate of the Serial object used to initialize the library must match the baud rate setting within the Protractor. The Protractor must be reset for the new baud rate to take effect. The Protractor will remember the new Serial baud rate after it is powered down and restarted.

The Protractor has two Blue LEDs to provide visual feedback. By default, the LEDs indicate the location of the most visible object within view. The library provides a command to switch the LED behavior to indicate the location of the most open pathway. The library also provides a command to disable the feedback LEDs to save power or eliminate interference with other optical sensors nearby. Changes to the LED behavior are not remembered after the sensor is rebooted.

The Protractor library provides a command to change amount of time between sensor scans. By default, the sensor scans its field of view once every 15 milliseconds. The scan time can be as fast as every 15 milliseconds, or as slow as every 32 seconds. Significant power savings can be achieved by increasing the scan time. The average current consumption of the sensor can be estimated as 15 + TBD / scantime_ms = milliAmps. Changes to the scan time are not remembered after the sensor is rebooted.

If the Protractor's scan time is set to zero, continuous scanning will be disabled. The Protractor will scan for objects only when data is requested by the master. When data is requested, there will be a 15 millisecond delay before the Protractor responds with the requested data. Care must be taken to ensure the communication link with the master is able to accept this amount of delayed response without causing issues. To disable the Protractor, set the scan time to zero and don't make any requests for data.
